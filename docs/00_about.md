# Initiative Overview

This initiative is founded as a platform for open-source collaborations between SAP, SAP technology partners and customers, for unified tools and insights for SAP Landscapes

It should foster the collaboration between those parties for various technical dependencies at the Networking, Hardware and Operating System layers; all disparate efforts begin to join and offer SAP-run Enterprises with greater consistency across different platforms and clearer choice of their options.

The projects within this initiative should help SAP technical administrators (aka. SAP “Basis” admins) and infrastructure administrators to run their SAP systems, by providing:

- automation of SAP Landscapes infrastructure, OS preparation and SAP software installation with homogenous architectures,
- automation of common operational tasks,
- sizing tools and architectural guidance for SAP Landscapes,
- other technical deliverables and tools (usually dispersed across the web).

The ambition is to enable SAP-run businesses worldwide with similar daily problems, to overcome their challenges without following a singular and static approach from a single SAP Technology Partner (e.g. Cloud Service Provider documentation, or a Hypervisor vendor’s whitepaper document). Instead these projects under the SAP LinuxLab can be extended and used for bespoke requirements, or used by SAP Services Partners to improve implementation and maintenance services for SAP-run businesses.
